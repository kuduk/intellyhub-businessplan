\section{Business Model}
\subsection{Pricing Strategy \& Model}
Our pricing model is strategically designed to support a hybrid Product-Led Growth (PLG) and Sales-Led Growth (SLG) motion. The core philosophy is to offer a frictionless entry point for individual developers and small teams, while providing a clear, value-driven path for customers to scale into high-value enterprise plans.

The primary value metric is \textbf{concurrent execution capacity}, measured in "Pods." One Pod represents one automation running simultaneously. This provides customers with a tangible and predictable measure of the operational power they are purchasing.

\subsubsection{Upselling and Cross-Selling Strategies}

To maximize customer lifetime value and create a smooth growth path, we have implemented several strategic levers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Per-Pod Cross-Selling:} All paid plans (Standard, Business, and Scale) have the ability to purchase additional Pods on an Ã  la carte basis. This provides flexibility for customers experiencing growth. The price for an add-on Pod is set at a premium---\textbf{\euro{25} per month}---which is proportionally higher than the effective per-pod cost within the plan bundles. This price structure ensures that while customers have flexibility, the most cost-effective solution for significant growth is always to upgrade to the next tier.

    \item \textbf{Strategic Hard Caps for Upselling:} Each plan has a pre-defined maximum number of total Pods it can support, including add-ons (e.g., the Business plan is capped at 25 total Pods). This ceiling is a strategic tool: it creates a compelling event for customers who consistently operate near this limit, forcing a conversation with our sales team to migrate to a higher-tier plan. This transforms the need for more capacity into a qualified, high-value sales lead.

    \item \textbf{Feature Gating:} Value is not only defined by capacity. Each pricing tier unlocks qualitatively different features, creating a "value ladder." The Business plan unlocks collaboration (RBAC, Teams), the Scale plan unlocks greater scalability and integration (SSO), and the Enterprise plan unlocks unique platform intelligence (AI-driven analysis and auditing). This ensures that upgrades are driven by a need for new capabilities, not just more capacity.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pricing Criticality and Risk Mitigation}

The primary strategic risk in this model is the significant price and value gap that remains between the upper-mid-market tier (`Scale`) and the high-end `Enterprise` plan. While our `Scale` plan provides a bridge, customers must still be guided across a substantial value proposition change to move to a full enterprise contract.

This is a deliberate strategic choice designed to clearly segment the market between self-service-oriented customers and high-touch enterprise partners. We mitigate this risk by ensuring our `Enterprise` offering provides unique, mission-critical features (like the AI Auditing platform) that are impossible to replicate with capacity add-ons alone, making the value proposition clear and compelling for organizations that require such capabilities.
