\section{Executive Summary}
IntellyHub is an AI Workflow and Agent Orchestration Platform that enables organizations to build, deploy, and manage complex AI-driven workflows and autonomous agents. It bridges the gap between traditional automation tools and cutting-edge AI frameworks by providing a unified \textbf{enterprise-grade platform} for orchestrating multiple AI models (LLMs), MCP Servers, retrieval-aug\-ment\-ed generation (RAG) pipelines, custom Python logic, and traditional app integrations. 

The platform's hybrid visual/code IDE and extensible plugin system empower both AI engineers and DevOps teams to operationalize AI solutions without deep infrastructure expertise. 

IntellyHub's \textbf{product-led growth strategy} (free tier and self-serve tools) is designed to drive rapid adoption among developers, with conversion to paid plans as usage scales. Given the explosive growth of AI automation/AutoML and MLOps markets (48,3\% annual\cite{AIMarket} and 39,8\%\cite{MLOpsMarket}), IntellyHub is poised to capture this convergence by offering the \textbf{security, governance, and scalability} that enterprises require alongside the flexibility developers demand.

We project strong user adoption and revenue growth over the next three years, supported by a high-value SaaS business model targeting AI/ML engineering use cases.
